K2Tree
===

This is a Rust implementation of the K2-Tree data structure, as described in the paper
"K2-Tree: A K2-Tree Based Data Structure for Massive Graphs" by Li et al. The K2-Tree is a data structure for storing
graphs that is designed to be more space-efficient than the adjacency matrix representation, while still allowing for
fast queries. The K2-Tree is based on the concept of a k2-tree, which is a tree structure that represents the
connectivity of a graph in a compact form.
